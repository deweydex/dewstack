"""dewstack's SQL cell runtime.

A trimmed relative of dewlab's `tutorial_tools.py` (`_run_sql_cell()`):
a dewstack SQL cell never runs arbitrary Python, only SQL, so this needs
none of that file's cell-execution, traceback, or widget machinery —
just enough to turn SQL text into an HTML table. No pandas here: a
plain sqlite3 cursor's columns and rows are enough for a table, and a
page whose only fenced blocks are SQL cells and checks loads only
`sqlite3` alongside core Pyodide (build.py works out which packages a
page needs from what is actually on it; see `render_body()`) — this
file staying pandas-free is what keeps that true. `get_connection()`
is the one door out: `python_tools.py`'s `read_sql()` calls it to pull
one of these tables into a DataFrame, on a page that also uses a
Python cell.

Loaded once per page (assets/sql-cell.js's boot()); every `.dl-sql-cell`
on that page keeps its own named connection here, so two cells sharing a
`db` name see the same tables and rows, and two different names never do.

The `check_*` functions below are the tentacular-plushies quiz's
self-check: each looks at a named connection's tables and returns one
line saying whether a task's requirements are met. They are a check, not
a grade — instant, run only when a reader clicks a button, and nothing
here records who ran one or what it found.
