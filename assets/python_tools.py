"""dewstack's Python/pandas cell runtime.

A trimmed relative of dewlab's `tutorial_tools.py`: dewstack's cells have
no widgets, no `check()` (that is `sql_tools.py`'s separate `check_*`
mechanism), and no notebook-wide state to manage beyond one namespace per
cell name — so this needs only the parts of dewlab's file that turn a
script into rendered output: capturing the last expression's value,
rendering a DataFrame as a table and a matplotlib figure as a PNG, and
catching whatever the script prints or raises. The rendering functions
below (`_figure_html()`, `_table_html()`, `_recolour_for_theme()`) are
ported near verbatim from dewlab's, including its reasoning for each.

Loaded once per page, alongside `sql_tools.py`, only when the page has a
`py cell=` block (build.py's `render_body()` decides this at build time
the same way it decides a page's Pyodide package list). `read_sql()` is
the bridge between the two: it calls `sql_tools.get_connection()` to
pull a SQL cell's own table into a DataFrame, so a page can open a real
dataset in SQL and chart it in the next cell down without an import.
