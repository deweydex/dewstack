"""Labels a freshly opened report issue by its page and its kind, creating
either label the first time either is needed.

The issue form (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/report.yml`) already applies
`source: page` on every report, but it cannot apply a label whose *value*
depends on what the student actually filled in — which page, which kind —
since a GitHub issue form's own `labels:` key is fixed text, not a template.
This does that second half, called once, right after an issue opens, by
`.github/workflows/label-report.yml`.

No `kind:` label exists for "a question, an idea, or something else" on
purpose: that kind is meant to leave through Discussions rather than land
here as an issue at all — if one does turn up, it gets `kind: question`
all the same, since a mislabelled report is still better found than lost.
Paired with the identical script in deweydex/dewlab.

    python3 tools/label_report.py <issue-number>

Needs `GITHUB_TOKEN` (an `issues: write` token — the job's own default
`GITHUB_TOKEN` already has this) and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` (`owner/repo`) in
the environment, which is exactly what a GitHub Actions job already sets.
