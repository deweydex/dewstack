# The box

Change `padding` below to `0`, then to `4rem`. The box changes size and
the border moves with it, but the word inside never does.

```html site=box
<div class="box">Content</div>
```

```css site=box
.box {
  background: #f6f4f0;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 4px solid #2c3e50;
  margin: 20px;
  border-radius: 8px;
}
```

Now try `margin` instead. The box itself stays the same size, but it moves
away from whatever is around it.

## Why this happens

Every element on a page is a rectangular box, whatever it looks like on
screen. Each box has three layers around its content, from the inside
out.

**Padding** is space between the content and the border. It takes on the
box's own background colour, the way the space inside a picture frame
does.

**Border** is the edge of the box. It can be visible, with a colour and a
style, or invisible, with no width at all. `border-radius` rounds its
corners.

**Margin** is space outside the border. It is always transparent, and it
pushes neighbouring boxes away rather than changing this box's own size.

## Your turn

Open your fork and find the `.card` rule in `styles.css`. Try padding of
`0`, then `4rem`, then `1rem 3rem` for different top-and-bottom versus
left-and-right spacing. Then find `border-radius` in the same rule. Try
`0` for sharp corners, `20px` for rounded ones, and `50%` to see what
happens to a shape that is not a circle. Add a visible border with
`border: 2px solid var(--accent-color);`.

## What you have now

A box with three layers you can now name and change on purpose.

- **Padding** — space between content and border; takes the box's
  background colour.
- **Border** — the box's edge, visible or not.
- **Margin** — space outside the border, always transparent.
