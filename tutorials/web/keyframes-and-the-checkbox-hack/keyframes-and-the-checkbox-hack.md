# Keyframe animation and the checkbox hack

`transition`, on the page about [transitions and
transforms](tutorial:transitions-and-transforms), animates a change
between two states, and needs something to trigger it, such as `:hover`.
A `@keyframes` animation goes further: it moves through several stages on
its own, with nothing to trigger it at all.

```html site=pulse
<button class="pulse">Loading…</button>
```

```css site=pulse
@keyframes pulse {
  0%, 100% {
    transform: scale(1);
    opacity: 1;
  }
  50% {
    transform: scale(1.08);
    opacity: 0.8;
  }
}
.pulse {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 6px;
  background: #2c3e50;
  color: white;
  animation: pulse 1.5s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

## Why this happens

`@keyframes pulse` names three stages, each a percentage of the way
through: `0%`, `50%`, `100%`. The browser fills in every frame between
one stage and the next on its own, the same way it fills in a
`transition`.

`animation: pulse 1.5s ease-in-out infinite;` is four settings in one
line: the keyframes rule to follow, how long one pass takes, and its
easing curve. The last setting is how many times to repeat it. `infinite`
means it never stops on its own. A number there instead, such as `3`,
would run the animation that many times and then stop on its final stage.

## A second pattern: the checkbox hack

A checkbox can show or hide content with no JavaScript at all. Click the
question below.

```html site=accordion
<input type="checkbox" id="q1" class="toggle">
<label for="q1" class="toggle-label">What is the checkbox hack?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
  <p>A pattern that shows or hides content using a hidden checkbox and
  the <code>:checked</code> selector, with no JavaScript at all.</p>
</div>
```

```css site=accordion
.toggle {
  display: none;
}
.toggle-label {
  display: block;
  padding: 10px;
  background: #f6f4f0;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  cursor: pointer;
}
.toggle-content {
  max-height: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  transition: max-height 0.3s ease;
}
.toggle:checked ~ .toggle-content {
  max-height: 200px;
}
```

## Why this happens

`label`'s `for="q1"` links it to the checkbox whose `id` is `q1`. Clicking
the label's text checks the box, even though `display: none` hides the
box itself. `:checked` matches only while a checkbox is
ticked, and `~` selects a later sibling in the HTML. Together, they give
`.toggle-content` its taller `max-height` only while the checkbox right
before it is checked. The `transition` on `.toggle-content` is what makes
that change slide rather than snap.

## Your turn

Add a second question to the accordion above. Give it a new checkbox
with its own `id`, a label with a matching `for`, and its own content
block below it. Give the checkbox a different `id` from the first one,
or the two boxes will answer to the same click. Then, in the first
editor, add a second button below the loading one. Give it its own
`@keyframes` rule and a different `animation-duration`, so the two
animate at different speeds.

## What you have now

Two ways to add movement or interaction with plain CSS: one that repeats
on its own, one that answers a click.

- **`@keyframes`** — names the stages of an animation as percentages, and
  the browser fills in the frames between them.
- **`animation`** — the shorthand that names a `@keyframes` rule, plus
  its duration, easing and how many times it repeats.
- **The checkbox hack** — a hidden checkbox, a label linked to it with
  `for`, and a `:checked ~` rule. Together, they reveal content only
  while the checkbox is ticked.
