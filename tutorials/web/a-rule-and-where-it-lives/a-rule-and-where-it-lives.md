# A rule, and where it lives

Change one line below and both paragraphs change colour, not just one.
Neither paragraph mentions colour at all.

```html site=rule
<p>First paragraph.</p>
<p>Second paragraph.</p>
```

```css site=rule
p {
  color: darkslateblue;
}
```

Try `firebrick` instead. Both change again, together.

## Why this happens

A CSS **rule** has two parts. A **selector** says which elements to style.
Inside curly braces after it come one or more **declarations**, each a
property and a value. `p { color: darkslateblue; }` is one rule: the
selector `p` matches every paragraph, and the declaration sets each one's
`color`.

A rule lives in `styles.css`, a separate file, not inside the HTML file it
styles. A `<link>` tag in the `<head>` connects the two:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

One stylesheet can style many pages at once, which is why `index.html` and
`about.html` look consistent without repeating any CSS.

## Your turn

Open your fork and find that `<link>` tag in the `<head>` of both
`index.html` and `about.html`. Then open `styles.css` itself and scroll
through it. It has many comments explaining what each section does; browse
them when you are curious.

## What you have now

A rule traced from the page it styles to the file it actually lives in.

- **Selector** — the part of a rule saying which elements to style.
- **Declaration** — a property and a value, inside a rule's braces.
- **Rule** — a selector plus one or more declarations.
